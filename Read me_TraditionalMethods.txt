I use four different traditional methods including RF SVM KNN and XGBOOST.

I first resize the datasets of those "png"s, but the results are not good. So I use librosa to extract some features like melmean and mfcc.
There are four different features I tried. The test dataset is folder 3. And the training datasets are other folders.

The results are so good on the training datasets but not well generalized which means behaving not well on the test dataset. The best result on the test dataset is just about 50%.

I will try different methods and datasets and features.

The 4 demos are including in this folder.
